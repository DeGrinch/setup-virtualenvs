## Description of the Script(s)

This script serves as a comprehensive tool for managing Python virtual environments. It begins by prompting the user to specify a root virtual directory. If no directory is provided, it defaults to `/virtualenvs`. The script navigates to this directory and creates a 'virtualenvs' subdirectory if it doesn't already exist. Within this structure, it generates the following management scripts:

- **create_venv.sh:** Allows the creation of new Python virtual environments by prompting the user for a location and name. It checks for the presence of 'python3-venv' and installs it if necessary. Upon successful creation, it activates the new environment.
- **delete_venv.sh:** Permits the deletion of a specific virtual environment. It requires the absolute path and name of the environment to be deleted, deactivates it if active, and then removes the environment directory if found.
- **list-venvs.sh:** Assists in listing all existing virtual environments within the specified root directory. It enumerates the environments in a numerical format for easy identification.

These scripts significantly streamline the process of creating, managing, and navigating Python virtual environments. They contribute to enhanced efficiency and organization within development environments.
